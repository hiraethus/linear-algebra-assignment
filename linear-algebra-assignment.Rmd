# Row and Column Picture of a linear model

## Solve the following linear system

`2x + y = 7`

`2x + 3y = 1`

### Answer
Given we can express this problem in the form `Ax = b`:

```{r}
A <- matrix(nrow = 2, data = c(2, 1, 1, 3))
colnames(A) <- c('x', 'y')
rownames(A) <- c('', '')
A

b <- matrix(nrow = 2, ncol = 1, data = c(7, 1))
colnames(b) <- c('')
rownames(b) <- c('', '')
b
```

Knowing that `x` = $A^{-1}$b, then

```{r}
x = solve(A) %*% b
x
```
