# Running the code in this document}
This document was compiled using the *Sweave* extension to R.
Sweave is an implementation of the *Literate Programming*
paradigm conceived of by Donald Knuth. This allows an author to weave `R`
code and text written in **LaTeX** together into one document.

To run the code from this document, follow these instructions:


1. Open the zipped directory containing this pdf
  (Alternatively, download the whole project from http://github.com/hiraethus/linear-algebra-assignment)
1. Open RStudio and load this project by choosing `File > Open Project` and navigating to the file `linear-algebra-assignment.Rproj`.
1. From the file browser in RStudio, choose `linear-algebra-assignment.Rnw`
1. Use the `chunks` menu located on the text editor opened in R to run each of the chunks in the file
1. Run all the code chunks in RStudio by typing `Ctrl + Alt + R`.
